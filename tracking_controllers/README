Package implementing inverse dynamics and system identification controller (allowing to send open-loop commands) for the Shadow Hand.

the SrhSystemIdentificationController is based on the SrhMixedPositionVelocityController with additonal services to send open loop commands and save the resulting response in form of text files.
Currently, 3 types of OL commands are available: 1=step, 2=sine, 3=sweep, parametrized by force magnitude, duration and start/final frequency (only necessary for the sweep)

To send an open loop step with duration of 1 sec and magnitude of 20: rosservice call /sh_ffj3_system_identification_controller/open_loop_command '{type: 1, duration: 1, magnitude: 20}'
To send an open loop sine with duration of 1 sec and magnitude of 10: rosservice call /sh_ffj3_system_identification_controller/open_loop_command '{type: 2, duration: 5, magnitude: 10}'
To send an open loop sweep with duration of 30 sec, magnitude 20 and start/stop frequency of 0.5/5 Hz: rosservice call /sh_ffj3_system_identification_controller/open_loop_command '{type: 3, duration: 30, magnitude: 20, w_0: 0.5, w_f: 5}'

After finishing the OL command, the controller servos back to the initial position before executing the OL command.

To save the obtained data: rosservice call /sh_ffj3_system_identification_controller/save_ol_data '{path: "/home/rkg/ros/motion_primitives/matlab/data/ffj3_step_1_20.txt"}'
